            <br />Are there changes you would like to make in your life&#63;
            <br />Some people want to achieve excellence in their chosen field such as sports, music or acting. Others want to make changes in their personal lives or may wish for more inward change, to be happier, more peaceful or loving. If we look closely at ourselves and at our lives, there is usually something we would like to change.</p>
        <p class="pindent">I discovered the Alexander Technique when I was working in the Theatre as an actress and writer, suffering from chronic back pain and looking for how I could change that. It helped me develop a strong back and much more&#33; I was so enthusiastic about the principles and practice that I decided to become a teacher.</p>
        <p class="pindent">At the same time I studied the esoteric teachings of the Chakras in England and America, and from this I learnt a lot more about the relationship of mind and body.</p>
        <p>Combining the principles of the Alexander Technique with an understanding of the Chakras inspired me to write my successful first book <a href="{% link books.md %}#theartofchanging" target="_self">The Art of Changing</a> with accompanying <a href="{% link books.md %}#theartofchangingcd" target="_self">CD</a>.</p>
        <p>I have developed a way of working which enables us to address the changes that we want to make, whether they be physical, psychological or spiritual and I am developing these ideas further in my forthcoming book <a href="{% link books.md %}#touchingthesoul" target="_self">Touching the Soul</a>.

        <p><span class="boldp">The Alexander Technique&hellip;</span> is a valuable system for bringing lasting change to the way we move and use our bodies and minds. Simple activities like sitting, standing, bending and walking can be done with greater ease and poise. Many people have received lasting relief from back, neck or shoulder pain, joint and muscle problems, mental and emotional stress and other health problems as a result of taking a course of lessons. Its effectiveness is well documented and has been the subject of a <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/337/bmj.a884.full" title="thebmj" target="_blank">scientific study</a> which was reported in the British Medical Journal. For more information visit <a href="http://www.alexandertechnique.com/" title="The Complete Guide to the Alexander Technique" target="_blank">The Complete Guide to the Alexander Technique</a>.</p>
        <p>Musicians, actors, dancers, singers and athletes have learnt the technique in order to improve the way they perform. Students of yoga, tai chi, meditation and other disciplines have applied it to their spiritual practice as it teaches the skills of being self-aware and present in the moment.</p>
        <p>Alexander teachers work with their hands, sometimes guiding you during movement such as walking, sitting and standing, playing an instrument, or other activities and sometimes during stillness while you are lying down on a therapy table. Touch is central to the work, and a large part of an Alexander teacher&#39;s training is learning how to use their hands in a way that will bring about the changes that they want to create in the musculature and the nervous system.</p>

        <p><span class="boldp">Chakra Therapy&hellip;</span> Chakra is a Sanskrit word meaning &lsquo;a wheel, a disc, or any arrangement in circular form or organization&rsquo;.  In the ancient Hindu spiritual philosophy there are seven major chakras which are located at critical turning points in the spine. Each chakra is connected with a critical turning point in our psychological and spiritual development from birth through to maturity.</p>
        <p>By learning about these different stages of our psychological development we have a framework for understanding ourselves, and we can work consciously to transform those parts of us that are wounded or stuck in unhelpful patterns of behaviour. Chakra Therapists are trained to work with gentle non-doing hands on the body, in addition to guiding clients in the process of understanding and working with the chakras, to bring about healing and spiritual growth. Chakra Therapy can be taught in workshops and courses or through individual sessions.</p>

        I left University with an honours degree in Philosophy and worked in the Professional Theatre for eleven years, In my mid-thirties, suffering from recurring back pain, I left the theatre and began training in the Alexander Technique.</p>
        <img src="/images/glenprofileimage2.png" alt="Glen working during a treatment session" width="251" height="372" border="0" align="left" />
        <p>Fairly early on in my training I began to see auras and energy and was advised to train in psychic development in order to gain an understanding of what I was experiencing. I trained in England and then in California, at the same time as completing my training as an Alexander Teacher. Together, these were my first steps on a journey of spiritual development.
        I found the two disciplines worked very well together and this prompted me to write my first book <a href="../books.html">The Art of Changing</a>.</p>
        <p>I call my work <a href="/popups/about-psycophysical">Psychophysical Integration</a> because I work with the physical, emotional, mental and spiritual aspects of the Self. I base my work on the Alexander Technique and on a philosophy of the chakras in which they represent the developmental unfolding of consciousness from the infant, through to maturity. This body centred work combined with meditation has formed the basis of my spiritual practice.</p>
        <p>I have recently moved from Devon to Haywards Heath in Sussex, where I am writing my latest book, running workshops in Psychophysical Integration, and seeing people individually.</p>

    <div id="about-psycophysical">
        <p><span class="boldp">Psychophysical Integration&hellip;</span> This combines the Alexander Technique and Chakra Therapy. The Alexander Technique works with unhelpful patterns of physical behaviour and with Chakra Therapy we can complement that process by working with unhelpful psychological patterns that we have developed.</p>
        <img src="/images/glenworking.png" alt="Glen Park" width="275" height="204" border="0" align="center" />
        <p>This work can bring about expansion and growth at physical, psychological and spiritual levels. Certified Alexander Teachers who have trained in Chakra Therapy and combine the two disciplines may call their work Psychophysical Integration.</p>
