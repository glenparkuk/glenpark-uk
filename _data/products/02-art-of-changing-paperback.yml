title: The Art of Changing

description: 
  <p><span class="pitalic">The Art of Changing</span> has established a fine reputation twice over as one of the very best introductions to the <a href="#" data-featherlight="#about-alexander" class="lightbox">Alexander Technique</a> and as a unique exploration into applying the principles of the Alexander Technique to psychological and energetic patterns of behaviour.</p>  <p>The authorâ€™s system of Chakra Therapy integrates healing touch with guided chakra visualizations, offering practical exercises to nourish and balance each chakra so it can be integrated and in harmony with the entire chakra system. She explores how to work with the Heart Chakra for deep transformation and self-healing, including healing emotional wounds from childhood and enabling the psychic and spiritual levels of the Throat and Eye Chakras to develop, with the potential of opening to the divine realm of the Crown Chakra. Sharing case studies from her Chakra Therapy practice, she shows how we gain a richer understanding of ourselves both mentally and physically by working with the chakras, opening ourselves to the potential for deep soul growth and transformation.</p>
  <div class="blockquotelime">An admirable and important book, the implications <br />are profound <span class="quotecreditinline"> &#126; Sir George Trevelyan</span></div>
  <p>Part One of the book is an excellent introduction to the Alexander Technique. The basic principles are explained clearly with the help of pictures, line drawings and observational exercises.</p>
  <p>Part Two of <span class="pitalic">The Art of Changing</span> Glen Park looks at how the Alexander principles can be applied to our psychological habits, our patterns of thoughts and feelings. It then goes on to look at the body as an energy system, working with the Hindu philosophy of the <a href="#" data-featherlight="#about-chakras" class="lightbox">Chakras</a> which explores the relationship between mind and body in some depth. Combining this wisdom with the Alexander principles can help us gain new insights into our psychological make-up with the potential to identify and transform unwanted patterns.</p>
