  alt: An Interview with Peggy Williams
title: An Interview with Peggy Williams
subtitle: (1916 â€“ 2003) Compiled
description: 
  <p>Peggy Williams began her training with FM Alexander in September 1946. She taught the Alexander Technique for over fifty years and the excellence of her work was recognised throughout the world.</p>
  <p>This interview is compiled from discussions which took place during a series of lessons Glen Park had with Peggy during her training in November 1981, in which she tape-recorded their conversation. Peggy talks about her training and her early challenges as an Alexander teacher.</p>
  <p>There are only a few dozen left of these interviews which can now be bought through this website. The pamphlets are over thirty years old (almost antiques!) so there may be a little rust around the staples.</p>
