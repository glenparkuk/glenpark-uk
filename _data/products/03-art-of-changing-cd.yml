  <h3><strong>Free access to audio during Coronavirus crisis</strong></h3>
  <p>Because of our current Coronavirus crisis, which means no-one can have Alexander Technique lessons and we can only work on ourselves, we have put a link to the guided visualisations on my audio CD. You can listen to them for free <a href="https://glenpark.uk/download/art-of-changing-cd" title="Listen to The Art of Changing CD on Soundcloud">here</a>, while you are lying in semi-supine. I hope you like them and you manage to stay well.</p>
